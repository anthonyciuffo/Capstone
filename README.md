The Impact of Socioeconomic and Institutional Factors on Student Performance

📌 Project Overview

This capstone project explores the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and institutional resources in shaping student academic achievement. Utilizing data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the USDA, this analysis aggregates over 19,000 school districts to determine if a combined model of SES and school resources better predicts graduation outcomes.

🚀 Technologies Used

Python: Data cleaning (Pandas), merging, and statistical visualization (Seaborn/Matplotlib).

Microsoft Power BI: Interactive dashboarding for exploratory analysis.

Google Colab (Jupyter): Cloud-based environment for executing data pipelines.

Excel/CSV: Raw data storage and processing.


📊 Key Findings

Socioeconomic Dominance: Poverty rates are the single strongest predictor of student graduation outcomes ($R^2 \approx 0.35$).

Institutional Impact: While less powerful than SES, lower student-teacher ratios are statistically associated with higher graduation categories.

The Combined Model: A model combining both SES and Institutional factors explains the most variance ($R^2 \approx 0.48$), supporting the hypothesis that holistic interventions are necessary for equity.

🔧 How to Run the Analysis

Upload the Raw_ data files to your Google Colab session or local directory.

Run data_cleaning_and_merging_script.py to generate the processed CSV.

Run generate_chapter_4_charts.py to reproduce the visualizations.
